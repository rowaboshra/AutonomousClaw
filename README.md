# Autonomous Claw

## Project Overview

The Autonomous Claw is a robotic claw designed to perform tasks autonomously. Developed using Arduino and C programming language, the project aims to provide an accurate and efficient solution for automated gripping and manipulation of objects.


## Introduction

The Autonomous Claw project demonstrates the integration of C programming with Arduino hardware to create a precision-driven robotic claw. It includes features like object detection, gripping, and release mechanisms.

## Features

- **Accurate Gripping:** Designed for precise object handling.
- **Autonomous Operation:** Utilizes sensors and predefined algorithms to perform tasks without manual intervention.
- **Customizable Code:** Written in C for ease of modification and optimization.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)
- Servo Motors (for claw movement)
- Ultrasonic Sensor (for object detection)
- Power Supply (battery or external power source)
- Claw Mechanism Components

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE (for compiling and uploading code)
- C programming knowledge (for understanding and modifying the code)

## Usage

1. **Power On:**
   - Turn on the power supply to the Arduino board.

2. **Observe Operation:**
   - The claw will automatically start its predefined sequence of operations, including object detection and gripping.

3. **Modify Code:**
   - To adjust the clawâ€™s behavior, open the `autonomous_claw.ino` file in the Arduino IDE and make changes as needed.
   - Re-upload the code to the Arduino after making modifications.
